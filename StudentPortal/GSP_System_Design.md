## Introduction

The Global Student Portal (GSP) is a comprehensive platform designed to serve multiple universities worldwide through a single, unified system. Unlike traditional university portals that operate in isolation for a single institution, GSP provides a scalable, multi-tenant architecture that enables universities to leverage a common infrastructure while maintaining their unique identities, workflows, and data isolation.
