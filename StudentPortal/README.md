# Global Student Portal (GSP) - System Design

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive system design for the **Global Student Portal (GSP)**, a multi-tenant educational platform designed to serve universities worldwide. Unlike traditional student portals that serve a single institution, GSP provides a scalable architecture that enables multiple universities to leverage a common infrastructure while maintaining their unique identities and workflows.

## Project Vision

To create a world-class student management ecosystem that connects academic institutions globally while respecting their autonomy and unique educational approaches. The GSP aims to standardize best practices while allowing for institutional customization, facilitating cross-institutional collaboration, and providing rich analytics across the educational ecosystem.

## Key Features

The Global Student Portal includes these core capabilities:

- **Multi-Institutional Support**: Complete isolation of data between universities while sharing common infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Student Experience**: From enrollment to graduation, including academics, finances, and communications
- **Faculty and Administration Tools**: Teaching support, grading, analytics, and institutional management
- **Global Collaboration**: Student exchange program support and cross-institutional learning opportunities
- **Advanced Analytics**: Insights into student performance, institutional metrics, and educational outcomes
- **Flexible Integration**: Connections to existing campus systems and third-party educational platforms
- **Mobile-First Design**: Full-featured experience on all devices with offline capabilities

## Multi-Tenancy Approach

The GSP employs a sophisticated multi-tenant architecture that allows multiple universities to share the same infrastructure while maintaining complete data isolation and customization options. Key aspects of this approach include:

- **Tenant Isolation**: Schema-based and row-level security approaches
- **Customization**: Institutional branding, workflows, and terminology
- **Resource Allocation**: Tier-based resource allocation by tenant size and requirements
- **Feature Toggles**: Institution-specific feature enablement
- **Integration Flexibility**: Custom integration points per institution

## Technical Architecture

The GSP is built on a cloud-native, microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI, Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Backend**: Microservices using Node.js and Java Spring Boot
- **Data**: PostgreSQL with multi-tenant design, Redis caching, Elasticsearch
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes orchestration, multi-region cloud deployment
- **Security**: OAuth2/OIDC authentication, RBAC/ABAC authorization, comprehensive encryption
